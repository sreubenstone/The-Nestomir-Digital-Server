# The Nestomir Digital Backend

### Overview

Let's create a timeless educational tale for the next generation of learners...earn community status and rewards‚Äìhelp push American (and global) STEM education forward ü§ì ‚òÑÔ∏è.

üò∫ _Please note, the codebase is a little messy. This was started a few years ago. We need your help to improve it._

See the [main project page here](https://www.thenestomir.com), as well as [the central story repository here](https://www.github.com/sreubenstone/thenestomir). Please see our Contributor Agreement & Additional Repository Terms at the bottom of this document.

### What is The Nestomir?

The Nestomir is a planetary quest (fantasy novel and companion app) involving a crash-landed alien warrior, a troubled 12-year-old boy, a mysterious learning force permeating the universe and 9 computer science lessons which grant students superpowers. It follows the main character, Jake Addison, through a series of quests which introduce him to computer programming and a new "learn with purpose" learning philosophy. **And now through crowd participation, we're going to improve the the story and the social reading app experience together.**

### How it works

- The book's manuscript and the native app (The Nestomir Digital) are stored in repositories on GitHub (any accepted pull request will grant you Major Contributor status)

- All Major Contributors will be listed/profiled in new versions of the book and app

- Make sure each pull request corresponds to one contribution type (if you want to make multiple contributions, issue multiple pull requests)

[See the offical Rules & Rewards page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12luzhhrRYnxpkwq94KIs0MvAgISujhLuVamU0S4sqbg/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more about our community participation details.

### Set up

##### Server

- clone this repository to your local machine

- toggle into the workspace directory

- run `npm i` to install all packages for project

- once database and .env file is set up, run `npm run start:dev` to start the server on port 4000

##### Local Database Setup

- set up local postgres database named `dendro`. See [this tutorial](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database) for installing postgres on your local machine. Note, it's always great to have a tool like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) to easily view the contents of your DB. See [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_create_database.htm) for creating a new postgres database on your local machine once you have postgres installed.

- run database migrations from local repository directory be running `knex migrate:latest`

##### Codebase structure

_src folder contains all server files_

- `server.ts`‚Äìapplication entry point, sets up express and /graphql endpoint, as well as other REST endpoints)
- `auth.ts` - authentication logic for server
- `schema.ts` - complete API schema (graphQL)
- `utilities.ts` - mash of utility functions
- `push.ts` - logic responsible for sending push notifications of expo infrastructure
- `gconvert.ts` - please ignore
- `/db` contains schema definitions (migrations)

##### Tech stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- graphQL (Apollo Server)
- postgres

##### env file

```
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET='place any random string here'
PGCONNECTSTRING='postgres://localhost/dendro'
SENDGRID_API_KEY='place any random string here...not needed on dev'
MIXPANEL_TOKEN='place any random string here...not needed on dev'

**Questions to help drive development**

- How can we better build relationships between readers?

- How can we leverage the concept of a Reading Buddy to enhance literacy building?

- How can we leverage the concept of a Reading Buddy to enhance how readers engage with the story?

- How can we make the application more interactive

- Can we/should we embed quizzes or other checkpoint related material into the E-Readers

- Are there other social features that might be interesting in this setting?

- How can we optimize the experience for the classroom

- How can we optimize the reader so it can be adopted by schools and classroom educators?
