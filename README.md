# The Nestomir Digital Backend

### Overview

Let's create a timeless educational tale for the next generation of learners...earn community status and rewards‚Äìhelp push American (and global) STEM education forward ü§ì ‚òÑÔ∏è.

See the [main project page here](https://www.incubatedd.com), as well as [the central story repository here](https://www.github.com/sreubenstone).

### What is The Nestomir?

The Nestomir is a planetary quest (fantasy novel and companion app) involving a crash-landed alien warrior, a troubled 12-year-old boy, a mysterious learning force permeating the universe and 9 computer science lessons which grant students superpowers. It follows the main character, Jake Addison, through a series of quests which introduce him to computer programming and a new "learn with purpose" learning philosophy. **And now through crowd participation, we're going to improve the the story and the social reading app experience together.**

### How it works

- The book's manuscript and the native app (The Nestomir Digital) are stored in repositories on GitHub (any accepted pull request will grant you Major Contributor status as well as participation points)

- All Major Contributors will be listed in new versions of the book and app

- Make sure each pull request corresponds to one contribution type (if you want to make multiple contributions, issue multiple pull requests)

[See the offical Rules & Rewards page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NKq1-DYcj6KLrF_zVx6q6SNO_ziVBNLQdH-744r1aTc/edit) to learn more about our community participation details.

### Set up

##### Server

- clone this repository to your local machine

- toggle into the workspace directory

- run `npm i` to install all packages for project

##### Local Database Setup

- set up local postgres database named `dendro`. See [this tutorial](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database) for installing postgres on your local machine. Note, it's always great to have a tool like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) to easily view the contents of your DB. See [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_create_database.htm) for creating a new postgres database on your local machine once you have postgres installed.

- run database migrations from local repository directory be running `knex migrate:latest`

##### Codebase structure

_src folder contains all server files_

- `server.ts`‚Äìapplication entry point, sets up express and /graphql endpoint, as well as other REST endpoints)
- `auth.ts` - authentication logic for server
- `schema.ts` - complete API schema (graphQL)
- `utilities.ts` - mash of utility functions
- `push.ts` - logic responsible for sending push notifications of expo infrastructure
- `gconvert.ts` - please ignore
- `/db` contains schema definitions (migrations)

##### env file

```

JWT_SECRET='place any random string here'

#### Ideas for Contributing

- Improve file structure, refactor code, improve server performance

- Create new features/functionality for The Nestomir Digital

- See comments in src files for further direction

**Questions to help drive development**

- How can we better build relationships between readers?

- How can we leverage the concept of a Reading Buddy to enhance literacy building?

- How can we leverage the concept of a Reading Buddy to enhance how readers engage with the story?

- How can we make the application more interactive

- Can we/should we embed quizzes or other checkpoint related material into the E-Readers

- Are there other social features that might be interesting in this setting?

- How can we optimize the experience for the classroom

- How can we optimize the reader so it can be adopted by schools and classroom educators?

Our [web platform](https://www.incubatedd.com/thenestomir) and [discord](https://discord.gg/thtjVaaq) community are buzzing with conversations and ideas about how to contribute to the book. Please check them out to get started.
